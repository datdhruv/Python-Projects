The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Source Code:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://github.com/shyamsalimkumar/Projects/blob/master/Security/caesar_cipher.py" target="">Caesar cipher Project with Source Code</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>👉&nbsp;Web Scraping with Selenium</b></div><div><br /></div><div><u>Summary of this Project:</u> You'll learn how to use webbrowser to open web pages, requests to download files from the internet, BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and selenium to control your web browser.</div><div><br /></div><div>Tutorial:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter12/" target="">Web scraping with Selenium Project by AI Sweigart</a></b>&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>👉 How to Build a Chat App using Network Programming Fundamentals</b></div><div><br /></div><div><u>Prerequisites:</u> Basic python experience is enough as the tutorial is an introductory guide to network programming only implementing the basic features for any chat app. You will also need the Python program installed on your computer and an IDE of your choosing.</div><div><br /></div><div>Tutorial:&nbsp;<b><a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/introduction-to-network-programming-in-python--cms-30459" target="">Build a chat app using network programming fundamentals by TutsPlus</a>&nbsp;</b></div><div><br /></div><div><b>👉 Build a Social Media like Twitter using Python, DJango, ReactJS &amp; More</b></div><div><br /></div><div><u>Project Summary:</u> If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to build a social network then this is the Python project for you.
